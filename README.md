This repository demonstrates a common C++ error involving dangling pointers and improper memory management. The `bug.cpp` file contains code that attempts to delete a pointer to a stack-allocated variable, leading to undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides a corrected version that avoids this issue.  This is a critical concept in C++ to understand to avoid crashes and memory leaks.
